# Software Development Kit
This is a SDK library generated by [`@nestia/migrate`](https://nestia.io/docs/migrate) or [`@nestia/editor`](https://nestia.io/docs/editor).

With this SDK library, you can easily and safely interact with backend server.

Just import and call some API functions like gif image below:

![nestia-sdk-demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13158709/215004990-368c589d-7101-404e-b81b-fbc936382f05.gif)

> Left is server code, and right is client code utilizing the SDK




## How to Test
```bash
npm install
npm start # run only "test/start.ts" file
npm run test # everything under the "test/features" directory
npm run test:simulate # "test/features" with mockup simulation mode
```

If you run `npm start` command, only [test/start.ts](test/start.ts) file would be executed.

Otherwise you run `npm run test` command instead, run everything in the [test/features](test/features) directory.

For reference, the [test/features](test/features) directory and E2E test functions (for each API endpoints) would be automatically composed only when you've configured the "E2E test function generation mode" of the `@nestia/migrate` (or `@nestia/editor`).

```bash
npm install -g @nestia/migrate
npx @nestia/migrate
? Migration mode (Use arrow keys):
    NestJS
  > SDK
? Swagger file location: assets/input/clickhouse.json
? Output directory path: assets/output/clickhouse-sdk-manual
? Mokup Simulator: true
? E2E Test Functions: true
```




## Deploy
```bash
npm install
npm run deploy
```

Just run `npm run deploy` command, then your SDK library would be published.

By the way, the initial package name of this template repository is `@ORGANIZATION/PROJECT-api`. I think it would better to change the word to your own organization and project name. If you're utilizing `VsCode`, you can do it through `Edit > Replace in Files` (*Ctrl + Shift + H*) feature.
